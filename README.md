# NAACL-HLT 2019 Schedule Data & Scripts

This repository contains the data files and processing scripts that are used to prepare the data used to populate the schedules in both the NAACL 2019 official website as well as the official Whova app.

This is a separate repository since it makes it much easier to use it as a git submodule in both the [website](https://github.com/naacl-org/naacl-hlt-2019) as well as the [app](https://github.com/naacl-org/naacl-app-2019) repositories. This will allow syncing any changes in the data files much easier.
