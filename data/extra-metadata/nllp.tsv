2	"Implicit Bias in the Judiciary"	"Daniel Chen, Elliott Ash and Arianna Ornaghi"	"Attitudes towards social groups such as women and racial minorities have been shown to be important determinants of individual’s decisions, but are hard to measure for those in policy making roles. In this paper, we study attitudes to- wards gender in the United States judiciary as expressed in written language. Using the universe of published opinions in U.S. Circuit Courts 1880-2013, we construct a measure of language bias by looking at the relative co-occurrence of sentiment words (e.g. positive versus negative, innocent versus guilty, career versus family) and words identifying gender. We find that judicial language dis- plays lexical gender bias. Judges displaying lexical bias against women tend to be older. Having daughters and increased exposure to female judges in a court reduce bias. Judges with lexical bias randomly assigned to women rights’ issues vote more conservatively. These results are robust to adjusting for a wide vari- ety of biographical covariates, and we find similar results for U.S. Congressmen using speech transcripts. Consistent with implicit bias, judges with stronger lexical bias are more prone to other forms of bias involving implicit cognition. Lexical bias of judges correlates with disparate treatment of female judges, in- cluding more frequent reversal of lower-court decisions by female judges. Fe- male judges also receive more dissents and concurrences, especially on panels with lexical bias, but female-authored opinions with dissents do not result in Supreme Court reversals."

Yet, they have legal effects on how the user's data can be collected, managed and used.  Ideally, we would like to empower users to inform themselves about the issues that matter to them, and enable them to selectively explore these issues. We present PrivacyQA, a corpus consisting of 1750 questions over the privacy policies of Mobile Applications, and over 3500 expert annotations of relevant answers. We observe that a strong neural baseline underperforms human performance by almost 0.3 F1 on PrivacyQA, suggesting considerable room for improvement for future systems. Further, we identify distinct challenges to answerability of questions within the privacy domain.  The PrivacyQA corpus offers a small but challenging corpus for question answering, with genuine real-world utility."

To assist in this process, we present FOCCUS, a commercial-scale system for legal review, which supports both review of individual contracts and comparison of contracts to other reference contracts. To support these tasks, the system employs transparent linguistic models that offer deep semantic understanding of contracts by leveraging multiple language technologies, including Abstract Meaning Representation, tense analysis, and information extraction. The transparency of the models allows them to be built even with limited ground truth data, which is often the case in practice, due to the proprietary nature of contracts. In addition, model transparency also allows for a systematic data science pipeline and associated tooling that allows for continuous improvement of said models, while offering robustness and consistency guarantees."
